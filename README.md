# Research compendium

A cookiecutter project structure for a research compendium, mostly derived from [Packaging data analytical work reproducibly using R (and friends)](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192/) by Marwick _et al._, 2018. This compendium has been adjusted
to fit Python and emphasizes notebook work, and has been developed for the course '[Getting started with Reproducible and Open Research](https://escience-academy.github.io/2020-02-11-Reproducible-and-Open-Research/)',
from the eScience Center.
